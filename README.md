# Emotion Recognition using data fusion

In order to use the 'DREAMER' database, you need to request it from the owners. All details are in the 'DREAMER.pdf' file.
I have also included a newer version of the dataset article in [DREAMER_A_Database_for_Emotion_Recognition_Through_EEG_and_ECG_Signals_From_Wireless_Low-cost_Off-the-Shelf_Devices.pdf](DREAMER_A_Database_for_Emotion_Recognition_Through_EEG_and_ECG_Signals_From_Wireless_Low-cost_Off-the-Shelf_Devices.pdf).

The report for the project is written in Persian as a part of my undergraduate studies. If you need any help or clarification, please contact me.

We reached the accuracy of 72.46% for 'Arousal' dimension of emotion, which is 10% more than literacture (62.32%)!
