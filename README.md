# Emotion_Recognition_B.Sc_thesis

My undergraduate project, under the supervision of Dr. Mohammad Bagher Shamsollahi. 

In order to use the 'DREAMER' database, you need to request it from the owners. All details are in the 'DREAMER.pdf' file.
I have also included a newer version of the dataset article in [DREAMER_A_Database_for_Emotion_Recognition_Through_EEG_and_ECG_Signals_From_Wireless_Low-cost_Off-the-Shelf_Devices.pdf](DREAMER_A_Database_for_Emotion_Recognition_Through_EEG_and_ECG_Signals_From_Wireless_Low-cost_Off-the-Shelf_Devices.pdf).

The report for the project is written in Persian as a part of my undergraduate studies. If you need any help or clarification, please contact me.
